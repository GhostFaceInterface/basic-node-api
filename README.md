# Node.js API with JWT Authentication and PostgreSQL

This is a simple Node.js API that uses JWT for authentication and interacts with a PostgreSQL database. The database contains several predefined SQL functions that are called from the API, making the code more readable and maintainable. The API endpoints have been tested and are fully functional using Postman.
